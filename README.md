# JavaScript Learning (Basic)

## Creating Variables in JavaScript
1. Using `var`: For creating variables that have life throughout the program
2. Using `let`: For creating variables that have block specific scope
3. Using `const`: For creating variables that are constant

Example: 

```js
var a = 2;
let b = 10;
const pi = 3.14;
```
